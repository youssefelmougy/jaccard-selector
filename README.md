# An Asynchronous Distributed Actor-based Approach to Jaccard Similarity for Genome Comparisons

## Abstract

The computation of genome similarity is important in computational biology applications, and is assessed by calculating Jaccard similarity of DNA sequencing sets. However, it’s challenging to find solutions that can compute Jaccard similarity with the efficiency and scalability needed to fully utilize capabilities of modern HPC hardware. We introduce a novel algorithm for computing Jaccard similarity for genome comparisons, founded on an actor-based programming model. Our algorithm takes advantage of fine-grained asynchronous computations, distributed/shared memory model, and the Fine-grained Asynchronous Bulk-Synchronous Parallelism execution model. Our performance results on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer demonstrate that this approach scales to 16,384 cores, showing an average of 3.6× and 5.5× improvement in execution time and hardware counters compared to a state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, we propose a novel compiler approach enabling programmers to optionally develop distributed code using the familiar BSP-based Partitioned Global Address Space model while automatically generating Actor-based code for improved performance.

## Installation Instructions

The following installation instructions are for the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). 

### Load the appropriate modules to prepare for setup

This loads the modules for both Selector and GenomeAtScale to prepare for setup.

```
source scripts/modules.sh
```

### First time setup and installation

This sets up and installs both the Selector and GenomeAtScale applications and their backend runtimes.

```
source scripts/setup.sh
```

## Running Instructions

The following running instructions are for the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). 

The run script (`/scripts/run.sh`) has 4 options:

```
   source /scripts/run.sh [selector | ctf | both] [1...inf] [1...inf] [0...5]
   
   [selector | ctf | both]             Selects which application (or both) to run
   [1...inf]                           Selects the number of cores for the run ([32...16384] used in the paper)
   [1...inf]                           Selects the number of nodes for the run ([1...512] used in the paper)
   [0...5]                             Selects the set of HWPC to collect (0:none, 1:L1DA/L1DM/L1IA/L1IM, 2:L2DR/L2DM/L2IR/L2IM, 3:TLBDM/TLBIM, 4:BRINS/BRMSP, 5:INS/CYC)
```

Note: when selecting the number of nodes for the run, please remember that GenomeAtScale uses 32 cores/node and Selector uses either 32 or 64 cores/node.

For example, `source /scripts/run.sh selector 1024 16 2` will run an experiment for the Selector application using 1024 cores on 16 nodes, collecting L2 cache statistics.

This will submit an sbatch file to the run queue at Perlmutter. At job completion, a `jaccard_selector.out` or `jaccard_ctf.out` or both will be created, showing the CMD output of the run. Moreover, if HWPC were collected, a directory with the structure `jaccard*+pat+*` will be created in `/Selector/hclib/modules/bale_actor/jaccard-selector/` or `/GenomeAtScale/jaccard-ctf/` or both. Please see the Output Interpretation section for instructions on how to understand these results.

## Output Interpretation

The following instructions are for understanding the results and relating them to the results found in the paper.

At the completion of each run, there are two outputs that are created:

```
jaccard_selector.out OR jaccard_ctf.out OR both          Output file from submitted job
jaccard_selector+pat+* OR jaccard+pat+* OR both          Output folder (in respective directory) from a CrayPat run if HWPC were collected
```

The `*.out` files contain the execution times of the run for the specific version. This result directly relates to Figure 2 (q) in the paper. An example output is shown below, where `0.06150 seconds` would be reported as the resulting value for the run.

```
...
Running jaccard on 128 threads
K-mer Matrix is 15000x5000 and has 15248 nonzeros.

Jaccard Similarity Matrix is 5000x5000 and has 12497374 values.

Running Jaccard Similarity K-mers (selector): 
  0.06150 seconds
...
```

The `jaccard*+pat+*` folders contain information dumped by the CrayPat profiler (for more information see https://docs.nersc.gov/tools/performance/craypat/). To generate human-readable content, we run `pat_report` on the respective directory. This will display information of interest for the specified HWPC in the run, and will directly relate to Figures 2 (a-p). An example output is shown below, where we can see the L1 cache statistics which would be reported as the resulting values for the run.
