/*
 * A locality graph defines the reachable hardware components from each locale
 * in a platform. It consists of a set of locales linked together by
 * bi-directional edges. Each locale should generally be associated with a
 * physical hardware component, though not necessarily a piece of the memory
 * hierarchy (as is the case with HPTs). For example, there can be locales for a
 * piece of L1 cache but there can also be locales for a network card to allow
 * the creation of work at that network card. At the moment locality graphs are
 * purely within a node, but this will probably change in the future.
 *
 * Given a defined locality graph for a platform, a worker path defines the path
 * through that locality graph that a certain worker thread takes when trying to
 * either 'pop' work that it has created or 'steal' work that other worker
 * threads have created. A worker path does not necessarily have to follow edges
 * in the locality graph, though doing so may have obvious locality benefits.
 *
 * These concepts generalize the ideas of communication threads, GPU threads,
 * PHI threads, etc that have been thrown around in the research for several
 * years now. A communication thread is simply a worker thread that includes an
 * interconnect locale in its list of pop or steal places. A GPU thread is a
 * worker thread that includes a GPU locale in its list of pop or steal places.
 *
 * Hand in hand with the idea of locality graphs and worker paths is the concept
 * of modules in HClib. A module is a plug-in (structured as a C++ header file)
 * that hooks into HClib to add the ability to do something in addition to
 * HClib's intrinsic dynamic tasking abilities. For example, an MPI module would
 * wrap an MPI library and might add calls such as MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, etc to
 * the hclib namespace. Under the covers, these calls would place tasks at
 * interconnect locales to later be serviced by threads that include the
 * interconnect locale in their pop/steal path. The ability to create tasks at
 * different locales is not limited to any subset of workers, i.e. any worker
 * can create work at any locale.
 *
 * This design does introduce the ability of the user to create a locality graph
 * and locality paths such that no worker ever services certain locales, leading
 * to deadlock. That is a user error and is not currently addressed. It would be
 * possible in the future to verify that all locales in a system are covered by
 * at least one worker path, guaranteeing that any tasks being created would be
 * executed eventually. However, this might also cause inefficiencies if we know
 * work will never be created at a certain locale for a given program but still
 * must visit it along at least one locale path.
