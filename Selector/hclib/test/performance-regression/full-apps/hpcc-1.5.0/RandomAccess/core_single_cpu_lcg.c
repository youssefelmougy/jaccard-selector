 *
 * GUPS (Giga UPdates per Second) is a measurement that profiles the memory
 * architecture of a system and is a measure of performance similar to MFLOPS.
 * The HPCS HPCchallenge RandomAccess benchmark is intended to exercise the
 * GUPS capability of a system, much like the LINPACK benchmark is intended to
 * exercise the MFLOPS capability of a computer.  In each case, we would
 * expect these benchmarks to achieve close to the "peak" capability of the
 * memory system. The extent of the similarities between RandomAccess and
 * LINPACK are limited to both benchmarks attempting to calculate a peak system
 * capability.
 *
 * GUPS is calculated by identifying the number of memory locations that can be
 * randomly updated in one second, divided by 1 billion (1e9). The term "randomly"
 * means that there is little relationship between one address to be updated and
 * the next, except that they occur in the space of one half the total system
 * memory.  An update is a read-modify-write operation on a table of 64-bit words.
 * An address is generated, the value at that address read from memory, modified
 * by an integer operation (add, and, or, xor) with a literal value, and that
 * new value is written back to memory.
 *
 * We are interested in knowing the GUPS performance of both entire systems and
 * system subcomponents --- e.g., the GUPS rating of a distributed memory
 * multiprocessor the GUPS rating of an SMP node, and the GUPS rating of a
 * single processor.  While there is typically a scaling of FLOPS with processor
 * count, a similar phenomenon may not always occur for GUPS.
 *
 * For additional information on the GUPS metric, the HPCchallenge RandomAccess
 * Benchmark,and the rules to run RandomAccess or modify it to optimize
 * performance -- see http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/
