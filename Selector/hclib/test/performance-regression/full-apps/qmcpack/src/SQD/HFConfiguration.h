 *Package to solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a centered (atomic-like)
 *spherically symmetric potential using the Numerov algorithm.

 *\section main_sec Schrodinger Equation
 *
 *The single-particle Schrodinger Equation involving the mass
 \f$m\f$ and an external potential \f$V(\bf r)\f$,
 \f[
 \left[-\frac{1}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\bf r)\right]\Psi(\bf r) = E \Psi(\bf r),
 \f]
 *is reduced to a Radial Schrodinger Equation
 \f[
 \left\{
 \frac{1}{2m}\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}}
 +\left[
 E-V(r)-\frac{l(l+1)}{2mr^{2}}
 \right]
 \right\} u_{l}(r)=0,
 \f]
 *for a spherically symmetric potentials \f$V(r)\f$ and the wave functions are
 \f[
 \Psi({\bf r}) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=-l}^{l} A_{lm}
 \frac{u_{l}(r)}{r}Y_{l}^{m}(\theta,\phi).

 *AtomicHF uses the Numerov algorithm to solve the Radial Schrodinger Equation.
 *Several external radial potentials are implemented which are defined
 *in \ref RadialPotential.
 *
 *Within Hartree-Fock approximation, the Schrodinger Equation is generalized
 *to include electron-electron Coulomb and exchange interactions (Hartree
 *and exchange terms). Hartree and Exchange terms are implemented in
 *HartreePotential and ExchangePotential, while the external potential and
 *kinetic energy terms are handled by ZOverRPotential,
 *HarmonicPotential, SJPseudopotential specific for the physical model.

 *\section numerov_sec Numemov algorithm
 *
 *Numerov algorithm (B. Numerov, Publ. de l'observ. astrophsique
 *central de Russie, vol. 2, p 188, 1933.) is based on a two-step, fifth order
 *predictor-corrector method for a second-order ordinary differential equation
 *of type \f[\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + k^2(x)y = S(x).\f]
 *Utilizing Taylor expansions for \f$x\f$, the solution is obtained by
 *recursively integrating forward in x as
 \f[
 (1+\frac{h^2}{12}k^2_{n+2})y_{n+2} -
 2(1-\frac{5h^2}{12}k^2_{n+1})y_{n+1} + (1+\frac{h^2}{12}k^2_n)y_n =
 \frac{h^2}{12}(S_{n+2}+10S_{n+1}+S_n) + \mathcal{O}(h^6).
 \f]
 *Numerov algorithm uses a uniform linear grid.
 Therefore, a transformation function is used to handle
 - transformations of variables between the physical grid to Numerov grid
 - cusp conditions or boundary conditions
 - range of the eigen values
 *
 *Any grid type can be used as far as the source functor can transform
 *the original grid variable to a uniform grid on \f$x\f$.
