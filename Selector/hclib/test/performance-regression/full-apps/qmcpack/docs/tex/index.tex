If you are building Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K for the first time, we recommend the \doxyref{Getting Started pages}{p.}{firstp}
\end{DoxyNote}
Currently, the Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K user guide is not meant to be a full introduction to Quantum Monte Carlo methods and are written on the assumption that users are familiar with various Q\+M\+C algorithms. There are many excellent tutorials and talks on Q\+M\+C methods and numerous published works. Over time this user guide will be expanded to describe more of the fundamentals of Q\+M\+C methods and well as their implementation and use in Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K.

A short list of Q\+M\+C tutorials and references includes


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\tt Quantum Monte Carlo training program 2014 at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility}
\item {\tt 2012 Summer School on Computational Materials Science\+: Quantum Monte Carlo\+: Theory and Fundamentals}
