\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C/\+C++ compilers
\item cmake, build utility, {\tt http\+://www.\+cmake.\+org/}
\item blas/lapack, numerical library, use platform-\/optimized libraries
\item libxml2, X\+M\+L parser, {\tt http\+://xmlsoft.\+org/}
\item hdf5, portable I/\+O library, {\tt http\+://www.\+hdfgroup.\+org/\+H\+D\+F5/}
\item boost, peer-\/reviewed portable C++ source libraries, {\tt http\+://www.\+boost.\+org}
\item fftw, F\+F\+T library, {\tt http\+://www.\+fftw.\+org/}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Einspline is distributed within Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K and does not need to be separately installed. For reference, the official U\+R\+L for the standalone einspline library is {\tt http\+://einspline.\+sourceforge.\+net/}

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Presence of the standalone einspline library in e.\+g. /usr/local can result in build errors in einspline related parts of Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K due to conflicts between internal and external header files. If this happens, remove the standalone einspline library include files and library archive.
\end{DoxyWarning}
\section{External libraries}\label{a00002_extlib_sec}
Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K uses several third-\/party tools and libraries. The selected packages are widely adopted by open-\/source communities and are generally available on H\+P\+C systems via module. They are included in standard Linux/cygwin distributions or can be installed by standard tools like yum. Installing these libraries with the source codes is straightforward. Because the header files are included by Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K, it is important to install developers’ version of each library. If these libraries are installed in standard directories, /usr /usr/local and /sw (Mac), no action is necessary.

Alternatively, environment variables X\+Y\+Z\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E should be set. Here, X\+Y\+Z stands for the name of package; the build utility can locate the libraries and use them. With few exceptions, the build utility cmake will look for {\ttfamily X\+Y\+Z\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E/include} for the header files and {\ttfamily X\+Y\+Z\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E/lib} for the library files. When multiple environment variables apply to a library, e.\+g., blas/lapack, the library is searched according to the listed order.

\begin{TabularC}{3}
\hline
\rowcolor{lightgray}{\bf Name }&{\bf Environment variables }&{\bf Comments  }\\\cline{1-3}
blas/lapack&{\ttfamily M\+K\+L\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E}, {\ttfamily L\+A\+P\+A\+C\+K}, {\ttfamily A\+T\+L\+A\+S}&Alternatives\+: vendor-\/provided blas, e.\+g., E\+S\+S\+L \\\cline{1-3}
hdf5 &{\ttfamily H\+D\+F5\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E}, {\ttfamily H\+D\+F\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E} &phdf5 is not necessary \\\cline{1-3}
libxml2 &{\ttfamily L\+I\+B\+X\+M\+L2\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E} &Configure with {\ttfamily --disable-\/shared --enable-\/static --without-\/python --without-\/http --without-\/ftp} \\\cline{1-3}
boost &{\ttfamily B\+O\+O\+S\+T\+\_\+\+H\+O\+M\+E} &Using only the header files. No need to compile the library. Simply download and unpack the package, if not installed on the system. \\\cline{1-3}

\section{Installing on generic U\+N\+I\+X, \char`\"{}quick install\char`\"{}, and build variants}\label{a00002_quickly}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
We assume that you are working in the qmcpack directory.
\end{DoxyNote}
When everything is installed in standard directores, {\ttfamily /usr}, {\ttfamily /usr/local} with default compilers 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd build
cmake ..
cmake ..
make -j8
\end{DoxyCode}
 This will create a binary with {\bfseries real trial wavefunctions}. Use as many threads as you can with {\ttfamily make} In the example, 8 threads are used.

On L\+I\+N\+U\+X, G\+N\+U compilers are the default.

If everything goes well, then you should see {\itshape qmcpack/build/bin/qmcapp}. Examples for several common U\+N\+I\+X-\/like systems are given below.

In addition, one has to build a binary with {\bfseries complex trial wavefunctions}. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build\_complex
cd build\_complex
cmake -DQMC\_COMPLEX=1 ..
make -j8
\end{DoxyCode}


To build C\+U\+D\+A version, 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build\_cuda
cd build\_cuda
cmake -DQMC\_CUDA=1 ..
make -j8
\end{DoxyCode}
\section{Installing Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K on Ubuntu Linux 14}\label{a00002_ubuntubuild}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
We assume that you are working in the qmcpack directory.
\end{DoxyNote}
(Tested in a Virtual\+Box V\+M in July 2014.) All the required packages are available in the default repositories making for a quick installation. Note that for convenience we use a generic B\+L\+A\+S. For production a platform optimized B\+L\+A\+S should be used.


\begin{DoxyCode}
apt-\textcolor{keyword}{get} subversion cmake g++ openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libboost-dev
apt-\textcolor{keyword}{get} libatlas-base-dev liblapack-dev libhdf5-dev libxml2-dev fftw3-dev
export CXX=mpiCC
cd build
cmake ..
cmake ..
make -j8
ls -l bin/qmcapp
\end{DoxyCode}


For qmca and other tools 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-\textcolor{keyword}{get} install python-numpy python-matplotlib
\end{DoxyCode}


To build the documentation you will also need to install graphviz and doxygen.\section{Installing Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K on Cent\+O\+S Linux 7}\label{a00002_centosbuild}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
We assume that you are working in the qmcpack directory.
\end{DoxyNote}
(Tested in a Virtual Box V\+M in July 2014.) Currently this version of Cent\+O\+S (Red Hat compatible) is using gcc 4.\+8.\+2. The installation is only complicated by the need to install another repository to obtain H\+D\+F5 packages. Note that for convenience we use a generic B\+L\+A\+S. For production a platform optimized B\+L\+A\+S should be used.


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo yum install make cmake gcc gcc-c++ subversion openmpi  openmpi-devel fftw fftw-devel boost boost-devel
       libxml2 libxml2-devel
sudo yum install blas-devel lapack-devel atlas-devel
module load mpi 
\end{DoxyCode}


To setup repoforge as a source for the H\+D\+F5 package, go to {\tt http\+://repoforge.\+org/use} . Install the appropriate up to date release package for your O\+S. By default the Cent\+O\+S Firefox will offer to run the installer. The Cent\+O\+S 6.\+5 settings were usable for H\+D\+F5 on Cent\+O\+S 7 in July 2014, but use Cent\+O\+S 7 versions when they become available. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel
\end{DoxyCode}


To build Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K 
\begin{DoxyCode}
module load mpi/openmpi-x86\_64
which mpirun
\textcolor{preprocessor}{# Sanity check; should print something like   /usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpirun}
export CXX=mpiCC
cd build
cmake ..
cmake ..
make -j8
ls -l bin/qmcapp
\end{DoxyCode}


To build the documentation you will also need to install graphviz and doxygen.\section{Installing Q\+M\+C\+P\+A\+C\+K on Mac O\+S X 10.\+9 Mavericks using Macports}\label{a00002_macbuild}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
We assume that you are working in the qmcpack directory. 
\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This build will fail if the standalone einspline library is in /usr/local. Remove the einspline include files, archive libraries, and rerun cmake if this occurs.
\end{DoxyWarning}
(Tested on a 2013 Mac Pro and mid-\/2011 Mac Book Air in July 2014).

These instructions assume a fresh installation of macports and for consistency with current Linux distributions, use the gcc 4.\+8.\+2 compiler. It is vital to ensure matching compilers/options for all packages and to force use of what is installed in /opt/local

Follow the Macports install instructions {\tt https\+://www.\+macports.\+org/install.\+php}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
