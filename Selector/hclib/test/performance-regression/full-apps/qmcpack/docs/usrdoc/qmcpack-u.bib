  abstract = {The Metropolis Monte Carlo method is used to sample the square of
	an antisymmetric wave function composed of a product of a Jastrow
	wave function and a number of Slater determinants. We calculate variational
	energies for 3He and several models of neutron matter. The first-order
	Wu-Feenberg expansion is shown always to underestimate the energy,
	sometimes seriously. The phase diagram for ground-state Yukawa matter
	is determined. There is a class of Yukawa potentials which do not
	lead to a crystal phase at any density.},
