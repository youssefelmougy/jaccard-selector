The files in this directory support making a modified version of
quantum espresso that includes the pw2qmcpack converter.

If you have already downloaded quantum espresso you can, e.g.,

patch -p1 -i ../add_pw2qmcpack_to_espresso-5.1.diff

from within the top level quantum espresso directory.

Alternatively, the download_and_patch_qe5.1.sh script will
automatically download and patch quantum espresso. After patching you
can move the espresso-5.1 directory anywhere convenient. There is no
need to keep it within the QMCPACK source tree.
