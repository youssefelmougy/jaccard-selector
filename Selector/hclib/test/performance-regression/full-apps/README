This directory contains a number of performance tests for the HClib runtime.
Currently, those tests are primarily taken from the Rodinia, Kastors, and BOTS
benchmark suites. When possible, these tests will also be run with both small
and large datasets. These tests output both the mean of the experiments run, as
well as the standard deviation.

These tests verify the performance of HClib in two ways. First, they compare new
runs of HClib benchmarks against old runs to assert that the performance of
HClib is not regressing relative to what it was in the past.

These tests also compare HClib against reference OpenMP versions of the same
benchmarks, with the HClib versions having been automatically generated to be
semantically equivalent using the OMP-to-X tool developed in the Habanero
Research Group:

These tests can be run manually an interactively using the run-all.sh script.
You can also submit the run-all.sh script to a SLURM job scheduling system.

For example, to run an instance of the regression tests that uses the Intel
compilers, runs each test ten times, and only tests the BOTS Sparse LU benchmark
on a SLURM system you would use the following command:

HCLIB_PERF_CXX=icpc HCLIB_PERF_CC=icc NTRIALS=10 TARGET_TEST=bots/sparselu_for/sparselu.icc.for-omp-tasks sbatch ./run-all.sh

If HCLIB_PERF_CXX and HCLIB_PERF_CC are not set, the tests will default to the
Intel compiler toolchain. If NTRIALS is not set, it will default to 10 trials.
If TARGET_TEST is not set, all tests will be run.

You can also toggle whether OMP continuations are created tied or untied by
manually editing the custom.mak file in this directory. Commenting all lines
will result in tied continuations, uncommenting will result in untied
continuations.
