This is a stress test doing a recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.
To build and run the example for Fib(5), simply "make run". You can change
the Fibonacci number by setting the WORKLOAD_ARGS environment variable.

    make run WORKLOAD_ARGS=10

By default, the program uses an async/finish strategy to compute Fib(N).
You can execute a version using futures for synchronization instead
(i.e., data-driven tasks, or DDTs) by passing a second argument:

    make run WORKLOAD_ARGS="10 DDT"

The value of the second argument doesn't actually matter, since the logic
just checks to see if it is present.
