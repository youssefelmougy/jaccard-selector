An Asynchronous Distributed Actor-based Approach to Jaccard Similarity for Genome Comparisons
----------------------------------------------------------------

The whole experiment consists of two phases, 1: Prepare dependencies, building the HClib library, and building the 
applications, 2: running the applications.

Getting Started
---------------

1) Prepare dependencies, build libraries, and build the applications:

    See the README file at https://github.com/youssefelmougy/jaccard-selector for setup instructions.

2) Run the Selector version of Jaccard similarity for genome comparisons:

    See the README file at https://github.com/youssefelmougy/jaccard-selector for run instructions
